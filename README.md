# Quantum DIY Kit Hardware Files

This repository contains all the hardware files necessary to build the PCBs and assemble the DIY kits. The PCBs can be ordered from for example [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) or [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/). The components can be sourced mostly from [Amazon](https://amazon.com/) or [Digikey](https://digikey.com/), according to the links in the BOM file.
